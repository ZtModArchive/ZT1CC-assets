After water has been sitting in a tank for a while, it will begin to become murky. This murkiness will be made worse when animals living in the tanks poo in them. While you can't actually see the poo that animals leave in their tanks, but it is there, making the water darker and darker. Eventually, the water will get so murky that your guests cannot see into the tanks to see the animals. There are two things you can do about this problem. First, you can assign a Marine Specialist to the tank. The marine specialist will clean the tank water when it becomes a problem. You can also purchase a tank filter. Tank filters are placed on the side of the tank. Tank filters also clean the water as it becomes murky. Purchasing a tank filter is an extra cost, but having it will free up your Marine Specialist to do other things, like running shows.
