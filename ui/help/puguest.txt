Guests can be picked up and moved manually. To pick up a guest, click him or her, then click the Pick Up Guest button. The guest will attach to your cursor. You can now place the guest somewhere else by moving the guest to the desired location and clicking. Placing guests into animals' exhibits can significantly reduce both guest and animal happiness. If you place the guest in water, they will attempt to swim to shore. If they cannot make it or they become trapped, they will drown. Be careful when placing guests into water tanks. Though they can swim to the ladder in order to escape, often sharks and other predators can swim faster.
