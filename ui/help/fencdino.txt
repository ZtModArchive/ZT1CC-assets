A dinosaur will walk through a fence if the fence isn’t strong enough to hold it or will merely step over it if it isn’t tall enough. The fencing used for regular animals won’t do the job. You need special fencing to contain dinosaurs, such as extra-tough concrete fences or dinosaur-proof electrified fences.
