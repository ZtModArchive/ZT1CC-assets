Six fence segments per side is a good start for a basic exhibit. Some animals, such as cheetahs, require lots of space. Others, like wildebeests, are happy with less space. Experiment to find what sizes are best for your animals.

Note: some larger dinosaurs will need a significant amount of space to be happy.
