Show objects are toys and trick objects that show animals use in show tanks. These are purchased from the Show Objects tab on the Adopt Animals panel. Show objects are placed on the surface of  tank water. A grid appears around the show object when you purchase it. This grid shows how much room the animal needs to use the object. The placement grid of show objects cannot intersect any other object.
