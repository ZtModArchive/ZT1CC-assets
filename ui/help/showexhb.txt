Show exhibits are the exhibits in which marine animals perform. These tanks are made with the special Show Tank walls on the Fences tab of the Construction panel. Show exhibits are built with gunite on the bottom. Note that foliage and benthic organisms may not be placed at the bottom of a show exhibit. Show objects may be placed on the water surface in a show exhibit. Any land upon which the show exhibit is built is flattened when the tank is built. When a show exhibit is created, it is automatically recessed into the ground and raised slightly above the surrounding land. If a show exhibit is placed adjacent to a marine exhibit, show animals will move between the marine and show exhibits using an automatically created portal (note that the connection must be at least three tiles wide and three tiles deep for the portal to be created).
