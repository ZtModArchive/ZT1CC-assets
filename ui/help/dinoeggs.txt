When you purchase a dinosaur, you receive a dinosaur egg. The egg can only be placed in an exhibit. Once placed, you may get information about the egg by clicking on it and consulting Scientist Recommendations. It’s very important that you have a scientist care for the egg before the dinosaur hatches. Eventually, the egg will hatch and a baby dinosaur will emerge. It will then grow to adulthood if it is cared for properly. If two dinosaurs mate, one will lay an egg in the exhibit. Be sure to protect the egg from egg-eating predators like the Allosaurus.
