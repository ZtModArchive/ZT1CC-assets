The expansion pack filter is a pull-down list at the top of many panels that allows you to sort the game content in many ways: Zoo Tycoon only, Dinosaur Digs only, Marine Mania only or All. This makes it much easier to find the right type of fencing or foliage. (Note that if you are funding a research or conservation program of a specific expansion pack, it will not be turned off if you are filtering on a different set of content.)
