If an animal becomes angry, they may trample their terrain. When terrain is trampled, it appears differently from other tiles around it and the tooltip for it reads "trampled terrain". There are two simple ways to find trampled terrain if your animals are complaining about it. If you turn on the grid (Ctrl+G) or switch to the change terrain type tab, the trampled terrain tiles are highlighted in amber. Also, if there is a large amount of foliage in an exhibit, you can find the trampled terrain by hiding the foliage (Ctrl+F). Remember, animals will only trample terrain if they are angry and they will only become angry if you are doing something wrong. If you take care of your animals and keep them happy enough, you may never even see any trampled terrain.
