As shown in the tutorials, shows can be scheduled and scripted using the Show Information panel, which is accessed by clicking the platform of the show tank. Several options are available to making a successful and profitable show, including how often a show is performed; the order, types, and number of tricks; admission fee, and the species to perform in the show (if there are multiple exhibit tanks attached to the show tank). The potential benefit of the show to the guests' happiness is also shown.
