Some animals can escape over certain types of fences. You may need to build natural obstacles, such as moats, to keep animals in their exhibits. Don’t put a tree next to a fence if you have animals that can climb--they’ll use the tree to escape! Most dinosaurs can easily escape through any non-electrified fence. Don’t let your dinosaurs escape! If they do, they could eat guests whole (removing them from the zoo) or go on a rampage and destroy buildings by trampling them.
