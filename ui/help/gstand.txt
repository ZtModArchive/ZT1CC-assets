Guests can watch and enjoy the new aquatic animal shows (for a fee) with the new show grandstands. Grandstands are placed facing a show tank with a one-tile buffer between the show and the building to provide easy access. Up to 12 guests can occupy the grandstand at any one time. The admission can be set using the Show Information panel. Guests will leave the grandstand when a show is over; whether they leave the show happy or angry is up to your skills as a Zoo Tycoon.
