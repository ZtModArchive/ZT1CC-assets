Some animals enjoy swimming in tanks but still need land to live upon. To make these animals happy, you can create a combined exhibit. Combined exhibits are exhibits that combine elements of land exhibits and marine exhibits. In order to build a combined exhibit, you must create a tank and have a land exhibit that is adjacent to it. You can do this in many ways. You can build the tank first and then create a land exhibit around it or up against it. You can build a land exhibit and then build a tank adjacent to it and then delete fence pieces that are adjacent to the tank. However, in order for animals to get into the tank, the top of the tank must be level with the land in the exhibit. The water in the tank can be either salt water or fresh water (although even if your tank water is fresh water, animals won’t drink it). Be careful though, because more than one land exhibit can share one tank, and animals can then swim through the tank to get into the exhibit of another animal!
