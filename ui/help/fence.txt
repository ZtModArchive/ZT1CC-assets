Fences also wear out over time. The fence types that last the longest, listed from most durable to least durable, are: electrified iron bars, electrified chain-link, reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete & iron bars, reinforced concrete & glass, concrete, iron bar, chain-link, glass, rail, stick, bar, rock, and wood. It’s important to note that the larger the fence, the sooner it will wear out. So, a tall chain fence won’t last as long as a short chain fence, for example. Use maintenance workers to repair fences or replace fence segments yourself.

Note: The electrified fences are dangerous to guests. Don’t electrocute your own guests!
