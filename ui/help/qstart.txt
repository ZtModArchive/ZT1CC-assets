The first thing your zoo needs is an exhibit for animals to live in. Let's build it!

1.  Click the Construction button. This button opens a panel with a bunch of tabs on it. The tab with a fence on it should already be selected for you; click it if it isn't. Then click one of the fences.

2.  Move the cursor to the grassy area. Click and drag the cursor to construct a section of fence, and then release the mouse button. Do it again until you’ve made a closed-in area. 

   You’ve built an exhibit! Give it a name in the box that pops up.
   Now you need to place an animal inside your exhibit.

3.  Click the Adopt Animals button. This button opens a panel with four tabs on it. Select the tab with the giant panda on it. Then click one of the animals.

4.  Move the cursor to the exhibit, and then click anywhere inside the exhibit to place your animal.

   That’s it! You’re ready to start building a bigger and better zoo.
