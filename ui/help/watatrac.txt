The swim shack, swim with dolphins, and boat rental shack must be placed entirely on either salt water or fresh water terrain tiles. There must be at least a few tiles of water at the exit of each water attraction building. Use the water terrain tiles located on the Terrain tab of the Construction menu, and then place the buildings adjacent to the water; the buildings will turn green to indicate where you can place the building. However, guests will not be able to enter without a path to the entrance.
